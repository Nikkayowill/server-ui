## Why This Works

**Healthy Margin Business:**
- $15 plan costs $6 (DO) = **60% margin**
- $35 plan costs $12 = **66% margin**
- $75 plan costs $24 = **68% margin**

**Yearly subscriptions improve cash flow and reduce churn.**

**Scalable:**
- Automation reduces manual work per customer
- Infrastructure scales horizontally
- Support burden decreases with documentation

**Sticky Customers:**
- Migration pain keeps customers subscribed
- Data lock-in (their server is with you)
- Long-term contracts for enterprise

**Differentiated:**
- Not just reselling - adding real convenience layer
- Dashboard, support, automation vs raw DigitalOcean
- Open source builds trust and community

## Success Metrics to Track

- **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)**
- **Churn Rate** (target: <5%/month)
- **Customer Acquisition Cost** (CAC)
- **Lifetime Value** (LTV) - aim for LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1
- **Gross Margin** (should stay 70-80%)
- **Support Tickets per Customer** (lower = better automation)
- **Upsell Rate** (% of customers buying add-ons)
